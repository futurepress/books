		<p>For a minute or twoshe stood looking at the house, when
		suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood (judging by his face only,
		she would have called him a fish)&#8212;and rapped loudly at the door with his
		knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery,with a round face and large eyes
		like a frog.</p>

		<p>The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, and this he
		handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, "For the Duchess.<a id="Page_32"
		class="pageno" title="[Pg 32]"></a> An invitation from the Queen to play croquet." The
		Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, "From the Queen. An invitation for the
		Duchess to play croquet." Then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled
		together.</p>
		
		<p>When Alice next peeped out, the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on
		the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky. Alice went timidly up to
		the door and knocked.</p>
		
		<p>"There's no sortof use in knocking," said the Footman, "and that for two reasons.
		First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they're
		making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you." And certainly there
		<i>was</i> a most extraordinary noise going on within&#8212;a constant howling and
	sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken
	to pieces.</p>
		
		<p>"How am I to get in?" asked Alice.</p>
		
		<p>"<i>Are</i> you to get in at all?" said the Footman. "That's the first question, you
		know."</p>
		
		<p>Alice opened the door and went in. The door led right into a large kitchen, which
		was full of smoke from one end to the other; the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged
		stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a
	large caldron which seemed to be full of soup.</p>
		
		<p>"There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!" Alice said to herself, as well as
		she could for sneezing. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and asforthe baby, it
		was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment'spause. The only two
		creatures<a id="Page_33" class="pageno" title="[Pg 33]"></a> in the kitchen that did
		<i>not</i> sneeze were the cook and a large cat, which was grinning from ear to
		ear.</p>
		
		<p>"Please would you tell me," said Alice, a little timidly, "why your cat grins like
		that?"</p>
		
		<p>"It's a Cheshire-Cat," said the Duchess,"and that's why."</p>
		
		<p>"I didn't know that Cheshire-Cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats
		<i>could</i> grin," said Alice.</p>
		
		<p>"You don't know much," said the Duchess, "and that's a fact."</p>
		
		<p>Just then the cook took the caldron of soupoff the fire, and at once set to work
		throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby&#8212;the fire-irons
		came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates and dishes. The Duchess took no
		notice of them, even when they hit her, and the baby was howling so much already that
		itwas quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.</p>
		
		<p>"Oh, <i>please</i> mind what you're doing!" cried Alice, jumping up and down in an
		agony of terror.</p>
		
		<p>"Here! You may nurse it a bit, if you like!" the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the
		baby at her as she spoke. "I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen," and
	she hurried out of the room.</p>
		
		<p>Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature
		and held out its arms and legs in all directions. "If I don't take this child away with
		me," thought Alice, "they're sure to kill it in a day or two. Wouldn't it be murder to
		leave it behind?" She said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in
		reply.<a id="Page_34" class="pageno" title="[Pg 34]"></a></p>
		
		<p>"If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear," said Alice, "I'll have nothing more
		to do with you. Mind now!"</p>
		
		<p>Alice was just beginning to think to herself, "Now, what am I to do with this
		creature, when I get it home?" when it grunted again so violently that Alice looked
		down into its face in some alarm. This time there could be <i>no</i> mistake about
		it&#8212;it was neither more nor less than a pig; so she set the little creature down
		and felt quite relieved to see it trot awayquietly into the wood.</p>
		
		<p>Alice was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire-Catsitting on a bough of a tree
	a few yards off. The Cat only grinned when it saw her. "Cheshire-Puss," began Alice,
		rather timidly, "would you please tell me which way I ought to gofrom here?"</p>
		
		<p>"In <i>that</i> direction," the Cat said, waving the right paw 'round, "lives a
		Hatter; and in <i>that</i> direction," waving the other paw, "lives a March Hare. Visit
		either you like; they're both mad."</p>
		
		<p>"But I don't want to go among mad people," Alice remarked.</p>
		
		<p>"Oh, you can't help that," said the Cat; "we're all mad here. Do you play croquet
		with the Queen to-day?"</p>
		
		<p>"I should like it very much," said Alice, "but I haven't been invited yet."</p>
		
		<p>"You'll see me there," said the Cat, and vanished.</p>
		
		<p>Alice had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March
		Hare; it was so large a house that she did not like to go near till she had nibbled
		some more of the left-hand bit of mushroom.</p>
