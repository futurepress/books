			The Rabbit Sends In A Little Bill</h2>
			
			<p>It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again and
			looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; Alice heard it
			muttering to itself, "The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh, my dear paws! Oh, my fur and
			whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where <i>can</i> I
			have dropped them, I wonder?" Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan
			and the pair of white kid-gloves and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for
			them, but they were nowhere to be seen&#8212;everything seemed to have changed since
			her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had
			vanished completely.<a id="Page_21" class="pageno" title="[Pg 21]"></a></p>
			
			<p>Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, and called to her, in an angry tone, "Why, Mary
			Ann, what <i>are</i> you doing out here? Run home this moment and fetch me a pair of
			gloves and a fan! Quick, now!"</p>
			
			<p>"He took me for his housemaid!" said Alice, as she ran off. "How surprised he'll be
			when he finds out who I am!" As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on
			the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name "W. RABBIT" engraved upon it.
			She went in without knocking and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet
			the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and
			gloves.</p>
			
			<p>By this time, Alice had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the
			window, and on it a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid-gloves; she took up
			the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room, when her eyes
			fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. She uncorked it and put it
			to her lips, saying to herself, "I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for, really,
			I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!"</p>
			
			<p>Before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the
			ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the
			bottle, remarking, "That's quite enough&#8212;I hope I sha'n't grow any more."</p>
			
			<p>Alas! It was too late to wish that! She went on growing and growing and very soon
			she had to kneel down on the floor. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource,
			she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney, and said to
			herself,<a id="Page_22" class="pageno" title="[Pg 22]"></a> "Now I	 can do no more,
		wha	tev	er happens. What <i>will</i> become of me?"</p>

		<p>Luckily for Alice, the little mag	ic b	ottle had now had its full effect and she grew
			no larger. After a few minutes she hear	d a voice outside and stopped to listen.</p>
			
			<p>"Mary Ann! Mary Ann!" said the voice	. "Fetch me my gloves this moment!" Thencame a
			little pattering of feet on the stairs. 	Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for
			her and she trembled till she shoo	k th	e house, quite forgetting that she was now about
			a thousand times as large as the 	Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it.</p>
			
			<p>Presently the Rabbit came up	 to the door and tried to open it; but as the door
			opened inwards and Alice's	 elbow was press	ed h	ard against it, that attempt proved a
			failure. Alice heard it sayto itself, "Then I'll g	o 'round and get in at the
			window."</p>
			
			<p>"<i>That</i> you won't!" thought Ali	ce; and after waiting till she fancied she heard
			the Rabbit just under the window, sh	e suddenly spread out her hand and<a id="Page_23"
			class="pageno" title="[Pg 23]"></a	> made asnatch in the air. She did not get hold of
		anything, but she heard a little s	hriek and a fall and a crash of	 bro	ken glass, from
		which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a c	ucumber-frame or
			something of that sort.</p>
			
			<p>Next came an angry voice&#8212;the Rabbit's&#8212;"	Pat!Pat! Where are you?" And
			then a voice she had never heard before, "Sure t	hen, I'm here! D	iggi	ng for apples, yer
			honor!"</p>
			
			<p>"Here! Come and help me out of this! Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the
			windo	w?"</p>
			
			<p>"Sure, it's an arm, yer honor!"</p>
			
			<p>"Well, it's got no business the	re, at any rate; go and take it away!"</p>
			
			<p>There was a long silence after this an	d Alice could only hear whispers now and then,
			and at last she spread out her hand ag	ain and made another snatch in the air. This time
			there were <i>two</i> little shrieks a	nd more sounds of brok	en g	lass. "I wonder what
			they'll do next!" thought Alice. "As for pulling me out of the wi	ndow, I only wish they
			<i>could</i>!"</p>
			
			<p>She waited for some time without h	earing anything more. At last came a rumbling of
			little cart-wheels and the sound of a 	good many voices all talking together. She made
			out the words: "Where's the other lad	der? Bill's got the other&#8212;Bill! Here, Bill!
			Will the roof bear?&#8212;Who's to g	o do	wn the chimney?&#8212;Nay, <i>I</i> sha'n't!
			<i>You</i> do it! Here, Bill! The master s	ays you've got to go down the chimney!"</p>
			
			<p>Alice drew her foot as far down the c	himney as she couldand waited till she heard a
			little animal scratching and scrambling a	bout in the chimney close above	
			<a id="Page_24" class="pageno" title="[Pg 24]"></a> her; then she gave one sharp kick	 and waited to see
			what would happen next.</p>
			
			<p>The first thing she heard was a	 general chorus of "There goes Bill!" then the
			Rabbit's voice alone&#8212;"Catc	h him, you by the hedge!" Then silence a	nd t	hen another
			confusion of voices&#8212;"Hold up his head&#8212;Brandy now&#8212;Don	't choke
			him&#8212;What happened to you?"</p>
			
			<p>Lastcame a little f	eeble, squeaking voice, "Well, I hardly know&#8212;No mor	e,
				thank ye. I'm better now&#8212;all I know is, something comes at me like a
			Jack-in-the	-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket!"</p>
			
			<p>Afte	r a 	minute or two of silence, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the
			Rabbit say	, "A barrowful will do, to begin with."</p>
			
			<p>"A barrowful of <i>what</i>?" though	t Alice. But she had not long to doubt, for the
			next moment a shower of little pe	bbles came rattling in at the window and some of them
			hither in the face. Alice no	ticed, with some surprise, that the pebbles were all
			turning into little cakes as they 	lay on the floor and	 abr	ight idea came into her
			head. "If Ieat one of these cakes," she thought, "it's sure to m	ake <i>some</i> change
			in my size."</p>
			
			<p>So she swallowed one of the cakes an	d was delighted to find that she began shrinking
			directly. As soon as she was small 	enough to get through the door, she ran out of the
			house and found quite a crowd of lit	tle animals and birds waiting outside. They all
				m	ade a rush at Alice the moment she ap	peared, but she ran off as hard 	as she could and
			soon found herself safe in a thick wood.</p>

			<p>"The first thing I've got to do," said Alice to herself, <a id="Page_25" class=
			"pageno" title="[Pg 25]"></a>as she wande red about in the wood, "is to grow to my right
			size again; and the second thing i	s to find my way into that lovely garden. I suppose I
			ought to eat or drink something or	 other, but the great question is 'What?'"</p>
			
		<p>Alice looked all arou	nd her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she could
			notsee anything that loo	kedlike the right thing to eat or drink under the
			circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
			herself. She stretched herself u	p on tiptoe and peeped over the edge and her eyes
			immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top, with
			its armsfolded, quietly smoking a long hookah a	nd taking not the smallest notice of
			her or of anything else.</p>
