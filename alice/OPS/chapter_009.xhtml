			<p>The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne
			when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them&#8212;all sorts of little
			birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before
			them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the
			White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the
			very middle of the court<a id="Page_43" class="pageno" title="[Pg 43]"></a> was a
			table, with a large dish of tarts upon it. "I wish they'd get the trial done," Alice
			thought, "and hand 'round the refreshments!"</p>

			<p>The judge, by the way, was the King and he wore his crown over his great wig.
			"That's the jury-box," thought Alice; "and those twelve creatures (some were animals
			and some were birds) I suppose they are the jurors."</p>
			
			<p>Just then the White Rabbit cried out "Silence in the court!"</p>
			
			<p>"Herald, read the accusation!" said the King.</p>
			
			<p>On this, the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, then unrolled the
			parchment-scroll and read as follows:</p>
			
			<div class="poem stanza">
				<span class="i0">"The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,<br /></span> <span class=
				"i2">All on a summer day;<br /></span> <span class="i0">The Knave of Hearts, he stole
				those tarts<br /></span> <span class="i2">And took them quite away!"<br /></span>
			</div>
			
			<p>"Call the first witness," said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on
			the trumpet and called out, "First witness!"</p>
			
			<p>The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with<a id="Page_44" class="pageno"
			title="[Pg 44]"></a> a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and butter in the
			other.</p>
			
			<p>"You ought to have finished," said the King. "When did you begin?"</p>
			
			<p>The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm in arm
			with the Dormouse. "Fourteenth of March, I <i>think</i> it was," he said.</p>
			
			<p>"Give your evidence," said the King, "and don't be nervous, or I'll have you
			executed on the spot."</p>
			
			<p>This did not seem to encourage the witness at all; he kept shifting from one foot to
			the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and, in his confusion, he bit a large piece
			out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter.</p>
			
			<p>Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation&#8212;she was beginning to
			grow larger again.</p>
			
			<p>The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and went down on one
			knee. "I'm a poor man, Your Majesty," he began.</p>
			
			<p>"You're a <i>very</i> poor <i>speaker</i>," said the King.</p>
			
			<p>"You may go," said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court.</p>
			
			<p>"Call the next witness!" said the King.</p>
			
			<p>The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in her hand and
			the people near the door began sneezing all at once.</p>
			
			<p>"Give your evidence," said the King.</p>
			
			<p>"Sha'n't," said the cook.</p>
			
			<p>The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said, in a low voice, "Your
			Majesty must cross-examine <i>this</i> witness."<a id="Page_45" class="pageno" title=
			"[Pg 45]"></a></p>
			
			<p>"Well, if I must, I must," the King said. "What are tarts made of?"</p>
			
			<p>"Pepper, mostly," said the cook.</p>
			
			<p>For some minutes the whole court was in confusion and by the time they had settled
			down again, the cook had disappeared.</p>
			
			<p>"Never mind!" said the King, "call the next witness."</p>
			
			<p>Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list. Imagine her surprise
			when he read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name "Alice!"</p>
